This is the overview of the prepare phase of the project.

Here are all sources that were used in this project:
https://datasets.imdbws.com/ (Official imdb data. We will only be using some of these; more details in the process phase)
https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/#namebasicstsvgz (Official description of imdb data)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies (Usability 10.0 Kaggle dataset)
https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/ (CPI data used to adjust for inflation)

Data integrity:
In this case, the official IMDB data is treated as the standard of the official movie data;
The Kaggle data that has a usability of 10.0 with a CC0 license has integrity and is for public use;
And the CPI data is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistic.

Data volume:
The IMDB data records much more than enough data, and the Kaggle dataset contains over 7000 movies.
The CPI data is updated frequently and contained all information up to the point of this project.
