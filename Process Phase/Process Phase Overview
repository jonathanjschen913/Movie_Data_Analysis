This is the overview of the process phase of the project.

In this phase of the project, we want to process our source data files so that we are ready to perform analysis.
For data entries with missing data points, we will be removing them since there is no logical default value for fields such as:
 - budget
 - revenue
 - rating

Here is a link to the IMDB files used in this project:

Alternatively, you can reproduce the same results by:
 1. Go to IMDB's official website, https://datasets.imdbws.com/
 2. Download the following:
    - title.ratings.tsv.gz
    - title.basics.tsv.gz
 3. Use a platform of your choice to retrieve data that is only up to July 5th, 2023.
