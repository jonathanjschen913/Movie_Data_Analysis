This is the overview of the ask phase of the project

In this phase, we want to understand the purpose of our project.
In particular, the goal of this project is to find what are the best predictors of success for a movie.
This leads to a couple of questions:
 - How will success be defined?
 - What variables do we consider as predictors?

The intuition:
 - We will define success using metrics that are mostly profit based.
 - We will consider variables such as budget, company, director, etc. for predictors.
 - We will NOT be considering variables such as the year released or "competition from other movies" as predictors since 
  these variables are much more difficult to control realistically.

Stakeholders:
 - Investors
 - Movie directors
 - Film distributors
